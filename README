Next release will follow a variable number of links on the website to aide in scanning an entire website rather than one page.

Usage:
Using python 2.7, execute emailScrape.py
Enter website to scrape
E-mails will output to screen

TODO:
** Enable scanning of entire website and not just a single page
** Output to a file named after the URL
